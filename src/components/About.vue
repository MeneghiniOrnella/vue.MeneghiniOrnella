    <p>In 2020, I decided to change the course of my career to a <b>Full Stack Developer</b>. I finished a degree in international trade because I had the objective and the perseverence to finish it. I am studying a technical degree in LinkedIn. Currently, I learn different lenguages and information about the IT World.</p>
    <p>My objetive is becoming a complete professional programmer. That is why I always look for courses, videos and complementary texts which help me to grow up professionally in a constant way.</p>
